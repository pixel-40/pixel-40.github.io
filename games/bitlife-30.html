    <p>BitLife is a browser‑based text-based strategy games designed for quick sessions and repeatable runs. It focuses on resource management, upgrades, and smart decisions, making it easy to pick up but rewarding as you learn the mechanics. You can play directly in your browser with no installation, which makes it convenient on both desktop and many mobile devices.</p><p>A little background: it has attracted a large audience (100M+ plays/visits listed), it has been available since September 29, 2018, it is associated with Candywriter, and it runs using Unity WebGL.</p><p>In BitLife, this exciting life simulation game, you can literally be anyone. Write your own life story from birth to death however you like by choosing different options, do different things, and make different decisions. Click on the green button to age, and as you age, there will be situations where you'll need to make the best decisions that will make your character successful. You can get a dream job, get married, have children... you can do anything. Experience countless lives all in your control in BitLife!</p><p><b>How to play:</b> Start with a simple goal—survive longer, finish a round, or complete an objective—then build consistency. Most players improve fastest by repeating the early moments of a match: learn where to move first, what to prioritize, and when to take risks. As you get comfortable, look for small advantages like better angles, smarter spacing, or cleaner execution.</p><p><b>Controls &amp; inputs:</b> The main inputs are Click. Check the in‑game menu for any extra shortcuts (pause, reset, or sensitivity). If you play on a laptop trackpad, lowering mouse sensitivity can make aiming and camera control smoother.</p><p><b>Tips for better results:</b> Headphones can help you notice audio cues, but the game is still fully playable muted. Use small, controlled movements rather than rushing—consistency usually beats speed. If you’re stuck, take a breath, reset your approach, and focus on one improvement at a time.</p><p><b>Why people keep coming back:</b> Short rounds make it easy to practice, and the core loop encourages you to beat your own personal best. Whether you’re aiming for a clean run, a faster time, or a higher score, improvements feel noticeable from session to session.</p><p><b>Good to know:</b> If you encounter slowdowns, try closing extra tabs, switching to another browser, or lowering quality settings (when available). For the best experience, keep the game window focused and avoid heavy downloads while playing.</p>
