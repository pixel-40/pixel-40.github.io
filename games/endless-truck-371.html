    <p>Endless Truck is a browser‑based physics-based strategy games designed for quick sessions and repeatable runs. It focuses on control, timing, and steady decision‑making, making it easy to pick up but rewarding as you learn the mechanics. You can play directly in your browser with no installation, which makes it convenient on both desktop and many mobile devices.</p><p>A little background: it has attracted a large audience (5M+ plays/visits listed), it has been available since September 2016, it is associated with Famobi, and it runs using HTML5, JavaScript.</p><p>In this fun truck driving game, you need to control your car to complete the missions of the level, while driving through obstacles and keeping fuel in check. Each level has three missions, and to beat the level, you need to complete all of them in one run. Tilt left or tilt right to perform flips in midair, and adjust the truck's balance to land perfectly and receive a boost! There are fuel boxes that recharge your fuel. Don't miss them or you'll run out of gas! Jump to get over obstacles. Every time you do a stunt or collect them during the drive, you earn cash which you can use to upgrade your truck and drive even longer and beat your personal record!</p><p><b>How to play:</b> Start with a simple goal—survive longer, finish a round, or complete an objective—then build consistency. Most players improve fastest by repeating the early moments of a match: learn where to move first, what to prioritize, and when to take risks. As you get comfortable, look for small advantages like better angles, smarter spacing, or cleaner execution.</p><p><b>Controls &amp; inputs:</b> The main inputs are Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Space. Check the in‑game menu for any extra shortcuts (pause, reset, or sensitivity). If you play on a laptop trackpad, lowering mouse sensitivity can make aiming and camera control smoother.</p><p><b>Tips for better results:</b> Use small, controlled movements rather than rushing—consistency usually beats speed. If you’re stuck, take a breath, reset your approach, and focus on one improvement at a time. If the game offers multiple modes, start with the simplest option and then increase difficulty gradually.</p><p><b>Why people keep coming back:</b> Short rounds make it easy to practice, and the core loop encourages you to beat your own personal best. Whether you’re aiming for a clean run, a faster time, or a higher score, improvements feel noticeable from session to session.</p><p><b>Good to know:</b> If you encounter slowdowns, try closing extra tabs, switching to another browser, or lowering quality settings (when available). For the best experience, keep the game window focused and avoid heavy downloads while playing.</p>
